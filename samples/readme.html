<center><b>FastInfoset (FI) Samples</b></center>
<br><br>
Listed here are a few samples demonstrating the FastInfoset implementation of SAX and StAX. 
To try out the samples, please follow the following steps:
<ol>
<li> Get FastInfoset source and build the package. A FastInfoset.jar will be generated 
under &lt;FastInfoset home&gt;/dist.  The Ant tasks for the samples have dependency on 
the jar file.</li>
<li> Get the source and data files for the sampless. Make sure to check out the whole samples package. All 
sources are under /src directory and XML files used in the samples are under /data directory.
</li>
<li> To run a sample, go to the samples directory and type ant &lt;target&gt;</li>
</ol>

Note that due to the fact that there might be some minor modifications to the specification 
of the encoding of Fast Infoset, FI files for the samples are not checked in. The ant targets 
for those samples that have dependencies on FI files, therefore, are set to run XMLToFI target 
first to generate FI files from XML files before the targeted tasks are run. For more details, 
you may run the JavaDoc target (ant doc) to generate JavaDocs under dist/javadoc/ and then 
browse index.html.

<tr><td rowspan=2>SAX</td>
    <td>FastInfosetParser</td>
    <td>The sample parses data/inv1a.finf as specified in the build.xml and handle SAX events 
        to display corresponding XML content.</td>
    <td>SAXParser</td>

<tr>
    <td>FastInfosetSerializer</td>
    <td>Directly using the FastInfoset SAX Serializer, the sample writes a small piece of XML 
        infoset taken from inv1a.xml into a 
        FastInfoset file called data/inv1c.finf. For details of the XML infoset, please refer to 
        <a href="dist/javadoc/index.html">samples JavaDoc</a>.</td>
    <td>SAXSerializer</td>
</tr>
<tr><td rowspan=3>StAX</td>
    <td>EventReader</td>
    <td>Demonstrate the use of FI StAX EventReader to read FI and XML files. The sample
        reads data/inv1a.xml and data/inv1a.finf and displays event types as it goes through
        the documents.<br>
        To try the sample with other xml files, edit the build.xml and change the "simple-xml-file" and 
         "simple-finf-file" properties to point to the files you may want to test. **Note that due to modifications 
        to the specification of the encoding of Fast Infoset, finf files have been removed from the repository. For 
        your convinence, an utility called XMLToFI is attached to this target so that when the target is called, 
        the xml file specified in property "simple-xml-file" is automatically transformed to create the finf file 
        specified in property "simple-finf-file".

    <td>StreamReader</td>
    <td>Demonstrate the use of FI StAX StreamReader to read FI files. The sample reads 
        data/inv1.finf and displays contents as it goes through the document.<br>
    
        Similar to the above EventReader, if you want to run the sample on other files, you would need to
        change the "simple-xml-file" and "simple-finf-file" properties to point to the files you may want to test. 
        The finf file specified will be generated automatically.
