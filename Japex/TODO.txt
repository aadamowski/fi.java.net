Bugs
----

 o Re-defining parameters such as japex.runIterations for a specific driver
 does not seem to have the desired effect.

Enhancements
------------

 o Global parameter japex.testsPerChart should be defined. Current value is
 8 but cannot be changed.

 o Result normalization? Certain charts are hard to read because of very
 large and very small absolute values.

 o Automatic detection of steady state. Is this possible at all? Santiago
 tried a simple algorithm using a standard deviation of a small set of
 of samples, but results were mixed.

 o Display progress information (including throughputs, etc.)

 o Include VM parameters such as -X??? or -mx??? in the output report.
