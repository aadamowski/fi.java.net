Japex Project: FastInfoset 
--------------------------

Introduction:

 This sample Japex project can be used to compare the performance of
 Fast Infoset against mainstream XML parsers. There are two sub-projects
 that can be used to measure parsing performance and document size, 
 respectively. For each sub-project there are two configuration files 
 that can be used:
 
 o Document size: size-config.xml and size-config-short.xml
 o Parsing performance: parsing-config.xml and parsing-config-short.xml
 
 that differ simply on the number of test cases. 
 
 Parsing performance is measured against Xerces [1], Piccolo [2], 
 XPP3[3], and the StAX RI parser [4]. However, none of these parsers are 
 bundled with this distribution and they must be downloaded separately 
 (it is assumed that Xerces is the default XML parser of your JRE, so 
 it does not need to be downloaded separately). The build file for
 this project assumes that the jars for all these parsers are located in
 ./lib. No additional downloads are required to run the document size 
 tests.

Drivers:
 
 The source code for each driver is located in ./src and its compiled
 version in ./dist/classes. In most cases, downloading the corresponding
 parser will be a requirement to compile a driver.

Building:

 >> ant compile

Running: 

 >> ant -Dconfig=... run
 
 where "..." stands for any of the configuration files shown above.
 
 Note that when running Japex on Unix servers, it is necessary
 to export the DISPLAY variable on the server's session in order for
 JFreeChart to render the charts generated by Japex. If the server
 does not host an X server session (and most server don't) you'll
 need to find a workstation to which you can point the DISPLAY 
 variable to (making sure to run 'xhost +server' in order to
 authorize the server to connect to that display).
