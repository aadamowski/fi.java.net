<P>As part of the Fast Infoset distribution we have included a tool
called Japex. Japex is a simple yet powerful tool to write Java-based
micro-benchmarks. It is similar in spirit to JUnit in that if factors
out most of the repetitive programming logic that is necessary to
write in micro-benchmarks. This logic includes loading and
initializing multiple drivers, warming up the VM, timing the inner
loop, etc. The input to Japex is an XML file describing a test suite;
the output is a timestamped report available in both XML and HTML
formats. 
</P>
<P>We have used Japex to produce a number of reports that estimate
parsing performance of our implementation as well as message size of
Fast Infoset documents vs. XML documents. Some of these reports are
listed below, but we encourage users to try out the Japex
configuration files (also included in the distribution) with their
XML instances to get a better estimate of the improvements that can
be achieved using this alternative serialization. The Fast Infoset
parsers that are part of the distribution have been developed with
performance in mind, yet we believe there is still room for
improvement so we welcome suggestions for enhancements that you may
find while doing your own testing.</P>

	Performace</A>: This report compares the performance of the Fast
	Infoset parser vs. several of the most popular XML parsers,
	including Sun's StAX implementation (SJSXP), Xerces, XPP3 and
	Piccolo. The test suite used to generate this report comprises of a
	variety of XML instances whose sizes range from less that one
	kilobyte to several megabytes.

	report compares message size of XML instances vs. Fast Infoset
	instances. The report considers the case of external vocabularies as
	well as two-phase encodings that combine serialization with
	redundancy-based compression (GZIP).
