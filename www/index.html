<p>Welcome to the Fast Infoset Project.
This is a project the Java community on
<a href="http://community.java.net/java-ws-xml">Web Services and XML</a>
at java.net.<br>
</p>
<p>Fast Infoset specifies a binary encoding for the <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML Information Set</a>.&nbsp;
An XML infoset (such as a <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html">DOM</a>
node, <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173">StAX</a> events or
<a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html">SAX</a>
events in
programmatic representations) may be serialized to an XML 1.x document
or, as specified by Fast Infoset, may be serialized to a fast infoset
document. Fast infoset documents are generally smaller in size and
faster to
parse and serialize than equivalent XML documents.<br>
</p>
<p>Analogies taken too far can lead to all sorts of misconceptions but
one can think of Fast Infoset as 'gzip' for XML:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fast Infoset optimizes the constraints of size and performance,
gzip optimizes only the constraint of size; and<br>
  </li>
  <li>Fast infoset documents are generally larger than gzipped XML
documents, however for small XML infosets this may not be always be the
case.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
</a>
<p>The goals of the Fast Infoset Project are to:<br>
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Develop highly performant Java-based implementations of Fast
Infoset serializers and parsers. Such implementations will be mostly
based on
standard XML APIs such as SAX or StAX. Extensions to such APIs will be
required to support the encoding of binary data;</li>
  <li> Develop useful functionality in support of the Fast Infoset
implementations;</li>
  <li> Integrate Fast Infoset serializers and parsers into Java-based
distributed communication platforms, such as Java-based Web services;
and</li>
  <li>Last but not least, foster a community of people interested in
developing and/or using Fast Infoset.</li>
</ol>
<a name="specification">
<h3>Fast Infoset specification and standardization</h3>
</a>
<p>The <a href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/xml/finf.htm">Fast Infoset</a>
specification, ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1
(Fast Infoset), is being standardized at the <a
 href="http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/index.asp">ITU-T</a>
and <a
 href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/stdsdevelopment/tc/tclist/TechnicalCommitteeDetailPage.TechnicalCommitteeDetail?COMMID=34">ISO</a>.
</p>
<p>It is currently at the stage of <a
 href="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=41327&amp;scopelist=PROGRAMME">First
Committee Draft in ISO</a> and is
under ballot, which finishes on the 1st of February 2005. The
specification will then go to Last Call in the ITU-T at the next Study
Group 17 meeting (February or March/April 2005).</p>
Unfortunately the specification is not available publically. One may be
able to get access to the specification if:
<ul>
  <li> One or one's company is an ITU-T sector member, or an Study
Group
17 associate member; or </li>
  <li> Through one's ISO National Body.</li>
</ul>
<p>Relevant to the Fast Infoset specification are two further
specifications under development:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/xml/fws.htm">Fast Web Services</a>
specifies alternative binary encodings for SOAP
messages without the need to modify <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</a>
service descriptions (the SOAP binding and ports do
not need to be augmented with new bindings and ports). Fast Infoset may
be used in conjunction with an optimized binary encoding of <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/">SOAP
1.2</a> messages (referred to as ASN.1 SOAP messages) or for the
serialization
of SOAP message infosets (<a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/">SOAP 1.1</a> or
SOAP 1.2) as fast infoset documents.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Security in Fast Infoset and Fast Web Services is a new proposed
work item that aims to specify how standard XML
security solutions, such as <a
 href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/">XML Signature</a>, XML
Encryption and <a
 href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf">SOAP
Message Security</a>, may be applied to Fast Infoset and Fast Web
Services.</li>
</ol>
<a name="current_state">
<h3>Current state of affairs</h3>
</a><br>
<p>Currently information is a bit thin on the ground. In due course
this project will be updated with more detailed
information on what is present and what needs to be done. However,
there should be enough information available to compile and play with
the source.<br>
</p>
<p>The source contains partial implementations of the Fast Infoset
specification for the SAX API and the StAX API. The SAX API is more
complete.</p>
<p>There are two routes to building the source:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Install <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>
4.0 and use either <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> (version
1.6.x) or the IDE to build the project; or </li>
  <li> Use the alternative ant build script, build-without-nb.xml, for
the case where <a href="http://netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>
4.0 is not installed.</li>
</ul>
A number of UNIX based scripts are present to convert XML documents to
fast infoset documents and vice versa. In addition other scripts will
test that it is possible to round trip an XML infoset to and from fast
infoset documents. For more information see the README.txt file.<br>
