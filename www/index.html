<H3><A NAME="introduction"></A>Introduction</H3>
<P>Fast Infoset specifies a binary encoding for the <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml-infoset/">XML
Information Set</A>.&nbsp; An XML infoset (such as a <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/w3c/dom/package-summary.html">DOM</A>
tree, <A HREF="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=173">StAX</A> events
or <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/org/xml/sax/package-summary.html">SAX</A>
events in programmatic representations) may be serialized to an XML
1.x document or, as specified by Fast Infoset, may be serialized to a
fast infoset document. Fast infoset documents are generally smaller
in size and faster to parse and serialize than equivalent XML
documents.</P>
<P>Analogies taken too far can lead to all sorts of misconceptions
but one can think of Fast Infoset as 'gzip' for XML:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Fast Infoset optimizes the
	properties of size and performance, gzip optimizes only the property
	of size; and</LI>
	<LI>Fast infoset documents are generally larger than gzipped XML
	documents, however for small XML infosets this may not be always be
	the case. 
	</LI>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="goals"></A>Goals</H3>
<P>The goals of the Fast Infoset Project are to:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Develop high performance
	Java-based implementations of Fast Infoset serializers and parsers.
	Such implementations will be mostly based on standard XML APIs such
	as SAX or StAX. Extensions to such APIs will be required to support
	the encoding of binary data; 
	</LI>
	<LI>Develop useful functionality in
	support of the Fast Infoset implementations; 
	</LI>
	<LI>Integrate Fast Infoset serializers
	and parsers into Java-based distributed communication platforms,
	such as Java-based Web services; and 
	</LI>
	<LI>Last but not least, foster a community of people interested
	in developing and/or using Fast Infoset. 
	</LI>
</OL>
<H3><A NAME="specification"></A>Fast Infoset specification and
standardization</H3>
<P>The <A HREF="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/xml/finf.htm">Fast Infoset</A>
specification, ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1 (Fast Infoset), is
being standardized at the <A HREF="http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/studygroups/com17/index.asp">ITU-T</A>
and <A HREF="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/stdsdevelopment/tc/tclist/TechnicalCommitteeDetailPage.TechnicalCommitteeDetail?COMMID=34">ISO</A>.
</P>
<P>It is currently at the stage of <A HREF="http://www.iso.org/iso/en/CatalogueDetailPage.CatalogueDetail?CSNUMBER=41327&amp;scopelist=PROGRAMME">First
Committee Draft in ISO</A> and is under ballot, which finishes on the
1st of February 2005. The specification will then go to Last Call in
the ITU-T at the next Study Group 17 meeting (February or March/April
2005).</P>
<P>Unfortunately the specification is not available publically.
However, it is possible to access the specification from: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>The ITU-T if you or your company
	is an ITU-T sector member, or a Study Group 17 associate member; or
	from</LI>
	<LI>Your ISO National Body. 
	</LI>
</UL>
<P>A <A HREF="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/xml/example-of-Fast-Infoset-for-UBL.htm">document</A> based on Annex D of ITU-T Rec. X.891 | ISO/IEC 24824-1 has been published that presents examples of encoding XML infosets as fast infoset documents.</P>
<P>Relevant to the Fast Infoset specification are two further
specifications under development:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><A HREF="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/xml/fws.htm">Fast
	Web Services</A> specifies alternative binary encodings for SOAP
	messages without the need to modify <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/wsdl">WSDL</A>
	service descriptions (the SOAP binding and ports do not need to be
	augmented with new bindings and ports). Fast Infoset may be used in
	conjunction with an optimized binary encoding of <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/soap12-part1/">SOAP
	1.2</A> messages (referred to as ASN.1 SOAP messages) or for the
	serialization of SOAP message infosets (<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/">SOAP
	1.1</A> or SOAP 1.2) as fast infoset documents.</LI>
<P></p>
	<LI>Security in Fast Infoset and Fast Web Services is a new
	proposed work item that aims to specify how standard XML security
	solutions, such as <A HREF="http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/">XML
	Signature</A>, XML Encryption and <A HREF="http://docs.oasis-open.org/wss/2004/01/oasis-200401-wss-soap-message-security-1.0.pdf">SOAP
	Message Security</A>, may be applied to Fast Infoset and Fast Web
	Services. 
	</LI>
</OL>
<H3><A NAME="features"></A>Features</H3>
<P>There are a number of features of Fast Infoset some of which are
highlighted in this <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/xml/fastinfoset/">article</A>.
A new article is required to fully explain all the features of Fast
Infoset.</P>
<P>Two important features of Fast Infoset are:</P>
<OL>
	<LI>Support for vocabularies defined
	externally, internally at the head or dynamically generated in the
	content of a fast infoset document. A vocabulary is a set tables
	consisting of strings and qualified names associated with an XML
	document, such strings may correspond to element and attribute names
	or namespace prefixes and namespace names. Using an external
	vocabulary, that is referenced by a URI, allows for smaller
	documents since the vocabulary of the document need not be encoded.
	A vocabulary at the head of a document allows for serializers to
	assign the smallest indexes to the most commonly repeated strings.
	Vocabulary dynamically in the content of the document allows for the
	support of streaming applications and extensibility of an XML
	infoset. All three forms of vocabulary may be used together.</LI>
<p></p>
	<LI>Support for binary encoding algorithms. Fast Infoset
	specifies built-in encoding algorithms such as for the encoding of
	integers and floating pointer numbers in binary form rather than as
	characters.&nbsp; Encoding algorithms specific to a vocabulary
	(external or at the head) may also be specified using URIs. This is
	useful for domain specific areas such as 2D or 3D graphics that
	specify algorithms for the encoding of co-ordinate data in binary
	form rather than as characters.</LI>
</OL>
<H3>Performance Reports</H3>
<P>As part of the Fast Infoset distribution we have included a tool
called Japex. Japex is a simple yet powerful tool to write Java-based
micro-benchmarks. It is            similar in spirit to JUnit in that
if factors out most of the repetitive programming logic that is
necessary to write in micro-benchmarks. This logic includes loading
and initializing multiple drivers, warming up the VM, timing the
inner loop, etc. The input to Japex is an XML file describing a test
suite; the output is a timestamped report available in both XML and
HTML formats. 
</P>
<P>We have used Japex to produce a number of reports that estimate
parsing performance of our implementation as well as message size of
Fast Infoset documents vs. XML documents. Some of these reports are
listed below, but we encourage users to try out the Japex
configuration files (also included in the distribution) with their
XML instances to get a better estimate of the improvements that can
be achieved using this alternative serialization. The Fast Infoset
parsers that are part of the distribution have been developed with
performance in mind, yet we believe there is still room for
improvement so we welcome suggestions for enhancements that you may
find while doing your own testing.</P>
<P>Reports:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="http://fi.dev.java.net/reports/parsing/report.html">Parsing
	Performace</A>: This report compares the performance of the Fast
	Infoset parser vs. several of the most popular XML parsers,
	including Sun's StAX implementation (SJSXP), Xerces, XPP3 and
	Piccolo. The test suite used to generate this report comprises of a
	variety of XML instances whose sizes range from less that one
	kilobyte to several megabytes.</LI>
	<LI><A HREF="http://fi.dev.java.net/reports/size/report.html">Compactness</A>:
	This report compares message size of XML instances vs. Fast Infoset
	instances. The report considers the case of external vocabularies as
	well as two-phase encodings that combine serialization with
	redundancy-based compression (GZIP).</LI>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="terms and conditions"></A>Terms and Conditions</H3>
<P>The FI code is made available under the terms of the Apache Source
License, version 2.0 (<A HREF="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">ASL
2.0</A>). ASL is a widely accepted and very flexible license; version
2.0 adds explicit terms to cover the conditions for accepting
contributions, reflecting experience gathered with the previous
versions of the ASL. There is a single copyright owner, Sun
Microsystems; multiple copyright owners can lead to very complicated
legal situations. 
</P>
<P>The project has two main goals: encourage adoption of the FI
standards and deliver an implementation that can be used directly in
production quality form by Sun's products. We will do our outmost to
balance both goals. Obviously, the more help we get from the wider
community, the more easily we can achieve both goals. 
</P>
<P>We have not yet finalized the governance structure. We expect a
structure similar to how it is practiced at Apache, with the
progression: user -&gt; bug reporter -&gt; bug fix submitter -&gt;
committer. 
</P>
<H3><A NAME="current_state"></A>Current state of affairs</H3>
<P>Currently information is a bit thin on the ground. In due course
this project will be updated with more detailed information on what
is present and what needs to be done. However, there should be enough
information available to compile and play with the source.</P>
<P>The source contains partial implementations of the Fast Infoset
specification for the SAX API and the StAX API. The SAX API is more
complete. Both support external vocabularies and dynamic generation.
Support for encoding algorithms is required by the specification, but
to take full advantage of these features additional interfaces to SAX
and StAX are needed in order to access data in non-character form.</P>
<P>There are two routes to building the source: 
</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Install <A HREF="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</A>
	4.0 and use either <A HREF="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</A> (version
	1.6.x) or the IDE to build the project; or 
	</LI>
	<LI>Use the alternative ant build script, build-without-nb.xml,
	for the case where <A HREF="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</A> 4.0
	is not installed. 
	</LI>
</UL>
<P>A number of UNIX based scripts are present to convert XML
documents to fast infoset documents and vice versa. In addition other
scripts will test that it is possible to round trip an XML infoset to
and from fast infoset documents. For more information see the
README.txt file.</P>
