  <h1><a name="INTRO"></a>1 Introduction</h1> 
  <p>Since its approval as a W3C recommendation in 1998, XML has been
	 adopted in a number of industries as a framework for the definition of the
	 messages exchanged in electronic commerce. The widespread use of XML has led to
	 the development of multiple industry-specific XML versions of such basic
	 documents as purchase orders, shipping notices, and invoices.</p> 
  <p>While industry-specific data formats have the advantage of maximal
	 optimization for their business context, the existence of different formats to
	 accomplish the same purpose in different business domains is attended by a
	 number of significant disadvantages as well.</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Developing and maintaining multiple versions of common business
		  documents like purchase orders and invoices is a major duplication of
		  effort.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Creating and maintaining multiple adapters to enable trading
		  relationships across domain boundaries is an even greater effort.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>The existence of multiple XML formats makes it much harder to
		  integrate XML business messages with back-office systems.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>The need to support an arbitrary number of XML formats makes tools
		  more expensive and trained workers harder to find.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL) is intended to help solve
	 these problems by defining a generic XML interchange format for business
	 documents that can be extended to meet the requirements of particular
	 industries. Specifically, UBL 1.0 provides the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>A library of XML schemas for reusable data components such as
		  &#x201C;Address,&#x201D; &#x201C;Item,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Payment&#x201D; &#x2014; the common data elements of everyday
		  business documents.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>A small set of XML schemas for common business documents such as
		  &#x201C;Order,&#x201D; &#x201C;Despatch Advice,&#x201D; and &#x201C;Invoice&#x201D; that are constructed from the UBL
		  library components and can be used in a generic order-to-invoice trading
		  context.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Support for the customization of UBL in specific trading
		  relationships.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>A standard basis for XML business schemas is expected to have the
	 following advantages:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Lower cost of integration, both among and within enterprises, through
		  the reuse of common data structures.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Lower cost of commercial software, because software written to process
		  a given XML tag set is much easier to develop than software that can handle an
		  unlimited number of tag sets.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>An easier learning curve, because users need master just a single
		  library.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Lower cost of entry and therefore quicker adoption by small and
		  medium-size enterprises (SMEs).</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Standardized training, resulting in many skilled workers.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>A universally available pool of system integrators.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Standardized, inexpensive data input and output tools.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>UBL is designed to provide a universally understood and
	 recognized commercial syntax for legally binding business
	 documents and to operate within a standard business
	 framework such as ISO 15000 (ebXML) to provide a
	 complete, standards-based infrastructure that can extend
	 the benefits of existing EDI systems to businesses of all
	 sizes. UBL is freely available to everyone without legal
	 encumbrance or licensing fees.</p>
  <p>UBL schemas are modular, reusable, and extensible in
	XML-aware ways. Designed as an implementation of ebXML
	Core Components Technical Specification 2.01, the UBL
	Library is based on a conceptual model of information
	components known as Business Information Entities (BIEs).
	These components are assembled into specific document
	models such as Order and Invoice.  These document assembly
	models are then transformed in accordance with UBL Naming
	and Design Rules into W3C XSD schema syntax. This approach
	facilitates the creation of UBL-based document types
	beyond those specified in this 1.0 release.  This document
	describes the basic order-to-invoice business process that
	the UBL document types are designed to support.</p>
  <p>To aid in deployment, the standard UBL schemas are
	accompanied by a multitude of informative supporting
	materials, some of which are included in this package 
	as informative appendices and
	some of which are available from referenced sites. These
	materials include:</p>
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>UML class diagrams of the document components on which the schemas are
		  based</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>UML class diagrams describing all the document assemblies</p></li> 
 	 <li>
		<p>Spreadsheet models defining the document assemblies</p></li>
	 <li> 
		<p>Descriptions of two example implementations</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Sample instances of each of the UBL documents used in those
		  two implementations</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Formatting specifications for
		rendering all of the documents in the example use
		cases</p></li>
	<li>
	        <p>Formatting specifications for the United
		Nations Layout Keys corresponding to each of the
		UBL basic business document types</p></li>
	 <li> 
		<p>An ASN.1 specification to enable the
		transmission of UBL messages in binary form</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h1><a name="PROCURE"></a>5 UBL 1.0 Procurement Process</h1> 
  <p>The UBL 1.0 documents and component library are designed to support a
	 typical order-to-invoice procurement cycle. This section describes the business
	 rules and choreography of the generic process and the role played by each of
	 the UBL 1.0 document types in that process.</p> 
  <p>It is important to note that the UBL library is designed to
	 support the construction of a wide variety of document types
	 beyond those provided in the 1.0 package. It is expected that
	 other document types will be added as UBL evolves.</p>
  <h2>5.1 The Order-to-Invoice Cycle</h2> 
  <p>This model describes a basic trading cycle from Order to
	Invoice that involves three parties: a Buyer of goods, a
	Seller of goods, and a Recipient of goods, who may or may
	not be the Buyer. The document types provided by UBL to
	support this process include the following:</p>
  <blockquote> 
	 <p>Order</p> 
	 <p>Order Response Simple</p> 
	 <p>Order Response (detailed)</p> 
	 <p>Order Change</p> 
	 <p>Order Cancellation</p> 
	 <p>Despatch Advice</p> 
	 <p>Receipt Advice</p> 
	 <p>Invoice</p> 
  </blockquote> 
  <p>The bold boxes in the diagram below show the role of each
	document type in the generic process.</p>

  <h2>5.2 Document Business Rules</h2>
  <p>This section describes the business rules of the
	generic order-to-invoice process that are assumed as
	information requirements for the document types in UBL 1.0.</p>
  <h3>5.2.1 Order</h3> 
  <p>The Order may specify allowance and charge instructions
	(e.g. freight, documentation, etc.) that identify the type
	of charge and who pays which charges. The Order can be
	placed &#x201C;on account&#x201D; against a trading credit account held
	by the Seller, or against a credit/debit card account, or
	a direct debit agreement.  The Order allows for an overall
	currency defining a default for all pricing and also a
	specific currency to be used for Invoicing. Within an
	Order, additional currencies can be specified both for
	individual item pricing and for any allowances or
	charges.</p>
  <p>Trade discount may be specified at the Order level. The Buyer may not know the
	 trade discount, in which case it is not specified. This makes a detailed
	 response from the Seller necessary; see Order Response (5.2.3).</p> 
  <p>The Order may specify delivery terms and constraints that apply for the
	 delivery location in relation to the following information that would normally
	 not appear until the Despatch Advice:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Transport</p> 
		<ul> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Means</p></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Mode</p></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>One- to many-legged shipment stages</p>
			 <ul> 
				<li> 
				  <p>Dates</p></li> 
				<li> 
				  <p>Locations</p></li> 
			 </ul></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Arrival &#x201C;window&#x201D;</p></li> 
		</ul></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Consignment packaging</p> 
		<ul> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Type, e.g. Container, Pallet</p></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Identifier, e.g. SSCC, Shipping label (Despatch Advice)</p></li> 
		</ul></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Order provides for multiple Order Lines. Each Order Line provides for
	 specification of a single place of delivery, and a schedule of quantities and
	 requested delivery dates.</p> 
  <p>The Order may specify delivery terms, while the Order Line may provide
	 instructions for delivery.</p> 
  <p>The Buyer may indicate potential alternatives that are acceptable. For
	 each Order Line, an Alternative Item can be included. The Alternative Item may
	 be specified by any one of the range of Item identifiers. For example, the
	 specified Quantity may change, e.g. 20x6-packs as an alternative to
	 10x12-packs.</p> 
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h3>5.2.2 Order Response Simple</h3> 
  <p>The Order Response Simple is the means by which the Seller confirms receipt
	 of the Order from the Buyer, indicating either commitment to fulfill without
	 change or that the Order has been rejected.</p> 
  <h3>5.2.3 Order Response</h3> 
  <p>Proposed changes by the Seller are accomplished through the full
	 Order Response document.</p> 
  <p>The Order Response proposes to replace the original Order. It
	 reflects the entire new state of an order transaction. It
	 also is the means by which the Seller confirms or
	 supplies Order-related details to the Buyer that were not
	 available to, or specified by, the Buyer at the time of
	 ordering.  These may include:</p>
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Delivery date, offered by the Seller if not specifically requested by
		  the Buyer</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Prices</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Trade Discount</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Charges</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Customs Commodity Classification codes</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Seller may advise replacements or substitutes which will be made, or
	 changes necessary, using the Order Response. The Substitute or Replacement Item
	 may be specified by any one of the range of Item identifiers. For example, the
	 specified Quantity may change, e.g. 20x6-packs as a replacement for
	 10x12-packs.</p> 
  <h3>5.2.4 Order Change</h3> 
  <p>The Buyer can change an established Order in two ways,
	 subject to the legal contract or trading partner
	 agreement: first, by sending an Order Change, or second,
	 by sending an Order Cancellation (see 5.2.5) followed by a new,
	 complete replacement Order.</p>
  <p>An Order Change reflects the entire current state of an order
	 transaction.</p> 
  <p>Buyers can initiate a change to a previously accepted order
	for various reasons, such as changing ordered items,
	quantity, delivery date, ship-to address, etc. Suppliers
	can accept or reject the Order Change using either
	Order Response or Order Response Simple.</p>
  <h3>5.2.5 Order Cancellation</h3> 
  <p>At any point of the process, a Buyer can cancel an established order
	 transaction using the Order Cancellation document. Legal contracts, trading
	 partner agreements, and business rules will restrict at what point an
	 Order Cancellation will be ignored (e.g. at the point of manufacture or
	 delivery process initiation). Given the agreements and rules, an
	 Order Cancellation may or may not be an automated business transaction. The
	 terms and conditions of contract formation for business commitments will
	 dictate which, if any, of these restrictions or guidelines will apply.</p> 
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h3> 5.2.6 Despatch Advice</h3> 
  <p>The following information may appear in the Despatch Advice:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Transport</p> 
		<ul> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Means</p></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Mode</p></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>One- to many-legged shipment stages</p>
			 <ul> 
				<li> 
				  <p>Dates</p></li> 
				<li> 
				  <p>Locations</p></li> 
			 </ul></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Arrival &#x201C;window&#x201D;</p></li> 
		</ul></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Consignment packaging</p> 
		<ul> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Type, e.g. Container, Pallet</p></li> 
		  <li> 
			 <p>Identifier, e.g. SSCC, Shipping label (DespatchAdvice)</p></li> 
		</ul></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Despatch Advice provides for two situations:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Organization of the delivery set of items by Transport Handling
		  Unit(s) so that the Receiver can check the Transport Handling Unit and then
		  contained items. Quantities of the same item on the same Order Line may be
		  separated into different Transport Handling Units, and hence appear on separate
		  Despatch Lines within a Transport Handling Unit.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Organization of the delivery set of items by Despatch Line, annotated
		  by the Transport Handling Unit in which they are placed, to facilitate checking
		  against the Order. For convenience, any Order Line split over multiple
		  Transport Handling Units will result in a Despatch Line for each Transport
		  Handling Unit they are contained in.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Additionally, in either case, the Despatch Advice can advise:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Full Despatch &#x2014; advising the Recipient and/or Buyer that all the
		  items on the order will be, or are being, delivered in one complete consignment
		  on a given date.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Partial Despatch &#x2014; advising the Recipient and/or Buyer that the
		  items on the order will be, or are being, partially delivered in a consignment
		  on a given date.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Despatch Lines of the Despatch Advice need not correspond
	 one-to-one with Order Lines, and are linked by a
	 reference. The information structure of the Despatch
	 Advice may result in multiple Despatch Lines from one
	 Order Line. Equally, partial despatch may result in some
	 Order Lines not being matched by any Line in a Despatch
	 Advice.</p>
  <p>Within a Despatch Advice, an Item may also indicate the Country of Origin
	 and the Hazardous nature of the Item.</p> 
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h3>5.2.7 Receipt Advice</h3> 
  <p>The Receipt Advice is sent by the Receiver (Buyer) to the Seller to confirm
	 receipt of items and is capable of reporting shortages or damaged
	 items.</p> 
  <p>The Receipt Advice provides for two situations. For ease of processing
	 claimed receipt against claimed delivery, it must be organised in the same
	 way as the corresponding Despatch Advice:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Indication of receipt by Transport Handling Unit(s) and contained
		  Receipt Lines one-to-one with the Despatch Advice as detailed by the Seller
		  party.</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Indication of receipt by Receipt Lines annotated by Transport Handling
		  Unit, one-to-one with the Despatch Advice as detailed by the Seller
		  party.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Receipt Advice allows the Receiver to state any shortages from the
	 claimed despatch quantity and to state any quantities rejected for a given
	 reason.</p> 
  <p>As presently arranged, the Receipt Line allows for one rejection
	 quantity and reason. However, additional reasons for
	 rejection of quantities of the same item 
	 could be achieved by subdividing the Receipt Line so that
	 there are multiple Receipt Lines to one Despatch Line.</p> 
  <h3>5.2.8 Invoice</h3> 
  <p>The Invoice is normally issued on the basis of one despatch event
	 triggering one invoice. An Invoice may also be issued for pre-payment on a
	 whole or partial basis. The possibilities are:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Prepayment invoice (payment expected)</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Pro-forma invoice (pre advice, payment not expected)</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Normal Invoice, on despatch for despatched items</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Invoice after return of ReceiptAdvice</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Invoice only contains the information that is necessary
	 for invoicing purposes. It does not reiterate any
	 information already established in the Order,
	 Order Change, Order Response, Despatch Advice, or
	 Receipt Advice that is not necessary when invoicing. If
	 necessary, the Invoice refers to the Order,
	 Despatch Advice or Receipt Advice by a Reference for those
	 documents.</p>
  <p>Taxation on the Invoice allows for compound taxes, the
	 sequence of calculation being implied by the sequence of
	 information repeated in the data stream (e.g., Energy
	 tax, with VAT &#x2014; Value Added Tax &#x2014;
	 superimposed).</p>
  <p>Charges can be specified either as a lump sum or by
	 percentage applied to the whole Invoice value prior to
	 calculation of taxes. Such charges cover:</p>
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Packaging</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Delivery/postage</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Freight</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Documentation</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>Each Invoice Line refers to any related Order Line(s) and may
	 also refer to the Despatch Line and/or Receipt Line.</p>
  <p>The Invoice does not cover Debit and Credit Notes, nor
	 does the process include a Customer Account Statement that
	 summarises Invoices, Credit Notes, and Debit Notes to be
	 paid.</p>
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h2>5.3 Item Business Rules</h2> 
  <p>Item structures are found throughout the document types in the generic
	 process.</p> 
  <h3>5.3.1 Item Identification</h3> 
  <p>An Identifier identifies each Item (e.g. a product identifier), which
	 shall be one of the following:</p> 
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Buyer&#x2019;s Item Identification, or</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Seller&#x2019;s Item Identification, or</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Manufacturer&#x2019;s Item Identification, or</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Catalogue Item Identification, or</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>Item Identification according to a system
		promulgated by a standards body.</p></li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The Item Identification assumes that each different packaging of an Item
	 (e.g. a 6-pack and a 12-pack of the same item) has a different Item
	 Identifier.</p> 
  <p>The Item may be further distinguished by the specification of
	 Measurement(s) or Physical Attribute(s). This enables specification of the
	 following kinds of item:</p> 
  <h4>5.3.1.1 Item Requiring Description</h4> 
  <p>This is an item that is not identified by an unambiguous
	 machine-processable product code and requires additional
	 descriptive information to precisely identify it.</p>
  <h4>5.3.1.2 Customer Defined Item</h4> 
  <p>This is an item that the customer describes according to his need, and in
	 the specification of which the customer may make some reference to comparable
	 &#x201C;standard&#x201D; items.</p> 
  <h4>5.3.1.3 Item Requiring Measurements</h4> 
  <p>This is an item for which it is necessary to specify one or more
	 measurements as part of the descriptive specification of the item.</p> 
  <h3>5.3.2 Item Pricing</h3> 
  <p>For any given Item, price ranges by amount, quantity, etc. are not repeated back
	 to the Seller; only the active price is specified. The Buyer may not know the
	 Item Base Price, in which case it is not specified. This makes a detailed
	 response from the Seller necessary; see OrderResponse.</p> 
  <h3>5.3.3 Other Item Details</h3>
  <p>Although ordered items may include Hazardous items, as it is not necessary to
	 specify related information at the order stage. The Buyer may not be aware of
	 the nature of the Item. Indication of the Hazardous nature of the Item, and any
	 relevant information, would be indicated in the Despatch Advice.</p> 
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h1><a name="SCHEMAS"></a>6 UBL 1.0 Schemas</h1> 
  <p>The UBL XSD schemas are implementations of the document assembly models defined
	 by UBL. They are the only normative representation of the UBL 1.0 document
	 types and library components.</p> 
  <p>All of the UBL 1.0 XSD schemas are contained in the <code>xsd/</code>
	 subdirectory of the UBL 1.0 release package (see Appendix A for more
	 information regarding the structure of the 1.0 release package and Section 6.4
	 for information regarding dependencies among the schema modules). The
	 <code>xsd/</code> directory is further subdivided into
	 <code>xsd/maindoc/</code>, <code>xsd/common/</code>, and
	 <code>xsd/codelist/</code> subdirectories.</p> 
  <p>For convenience in implementing the schemas, a parallel (and
	technically non-normative) &#x201C;runtime&#x201D; set with
	the annotation elements stripped out is provided in
	the <code>xsdrt/</code> directory.</p>
  <h2>6.1 UBL Document Schemas</h2> 
  <p>The XSD schemas defining the eight basic document types that support the
	 generic UBL 1.0 order-to-invoice process are located in the

  <h2>A.5 Recursive Structures</h2> 
  <p>Certain components in the library allow recursive nesting. For example, a
	 Package may contain other Packages, a Delivery may specify another Delivery,
	 etc. These are legitimate business data structures. Most real-world
	 applications will limit the depth of recursion in such structures, but XSD
	 schemas are incapable of expressing this constraint. Implementors should be
	 aware of this and may wish to set limits on the depth of recursive structures
	 in their applications.</p> 
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h1><a name="METHOD"></a>Appendix B (Informative): UBL Methodology</h1> 
  <h2>B.1 The UBL Development Approach</h2> 
  <p>UBL does not mandate the use of a specific formal development
	 method. The purpose of this section is to describe the
	 process that evolved during the development of UBL so
	 that implementers can understand the role of the various
	 technical artifacts included in this package. They may
	 also choose to adapt this approach to suit their
	 requirements.</p>
  <p>The approach used to develop UBL 1.0 is shown in the diagram below.</p> 
  <div><img src="art/UBL-1.0-DevProcess.jpg"
	 alt="[development process diagram]" /> 
	 <p><b>Figure B-1. The UBL Development Process</b></p></div> 
  <p>The initial UBL library of data components was based upon the
	 xCBL 3.0 schema library, which was itself based on the
	 UN/EDIFACT and ANSI X12 EDI component libraries.  Upon
	 review, it was felt necessary to create an abstracted
	 conceptual model of the entities in a form that would
	 better support an iterative development lifecycle.</p>
  <p>UBL uses two types of conceptual models, a single model for
	defining information components and a set of models for
	describing how these components are assembled into
	document definitions. The former is referred to as the
	document component model and is generally presented using
	UML class diagrams (see B.2 below); the latter are referred to as the
	document assembly models and are generally presented using
	spreadsheets.</p>
  <p>The identification and assembly of the components required by
	the UBL 1.0 Procurement Process was carried out manually
	using business knowledge of the domain, the component
	model, and the requirements of <a href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a>.
	Individual spreadsheets were developed for each document
	type in the UBL 1.0 procurement scenario, and all re-used
	components were combined into a separate
	spreadsheet. Additional spreadsheets were used to model the
	Core Component Types (CCTs), Unspecialized Datatypes
	(UDTs), and Specialized Datatypes (SDTs) as specified by
	<a href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a>. The full set of spreadsheet
	assembly models used by UBL 1.0 is described in Section
	B.3.</p>
  <p>The UBL schemas contained in Section 6 of this specification
	were then generated automatically from the spreadsheet
	assembly models following the UBL Naming and Design Rules
	referenced in Section B.4 according to the process
	described in Section B.5.  Implementation models were then
	generated from the schemas to serve as an aid in
	implementing UBL.  These UML class diagrams, provided in
	Section B.6, represent the implementation of the document
	assembly models described in the spreadsheets.</p>
  <h2>B.2 Component Model</h2> 
  <p>The UBL document component model describes the information components used
	 in all of the documents defined by UBL 1.0.</p>
  <p>The document component model is the result of a detailed
	 analysis of the data requirements to support the UBL 1.0
	 Procurement Process (see Section 5). During the modeling
	 process, common items of data were identified by a
	 process of normalization to identify aggregates based on
	 functional dependency.  Where appropriate, these were
	 generalized so that they could be re-used to support the
	 various business documents.</p>
  <p>The document component model is used for the following
	 purposes:</p>
  <ul> 
	 <li> 
		<p>It facilitates the identification of the reusable components &#x2014;
		  i.e., the data structures that are common across the UBL 1.0 business documents</p></li>
	 <li> 
		<p>It aids in understanding the information requirements of the
		  total scenario</p></li> 
	 <li> 
		<p>It is the source from which the BIEs are derived and documented in the
		  UBL document assembly models</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>The component model is best viewed as a series of UML Class
	Diagrams. For legibility, the model does not contain all
	the metadata required for document assembly.</p>
  <p>Figure B-2 shows the overall UBL document component model.</p> 
  <div class="newpage"></div>

	 <p><b>Figure B-2. UBL Document Component Model (click on image to
		enlarge)</b></p></div> 
  <p>To facilitate comprehension of this diagram, it has been
	 decomposed into several packages. Each package represents
	 a logical grouping of components and is described by its
	 own UML class diagram, which displays both the attributes
	 (Basic BIEs) and object classes (Aggregate BIEs)
	 belonging to the components grouped in the package. The
	 scope of each package is arbitrary and does not hold any
	 significance beyond these diagrams.</p>
  <div class="newpage"></div>

  <p>No specific directions are defined for the associations in
	these models; they can be navigated in either direction.
	The specific navigation path for each association is
	defined when documents are assembled.</p>
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h2>B.3 Document Assembly Models</h2> 
  <p>To define different types of documents, the components
	 described in the previous section are assembled into
	 hierarachical structures based on the requirements of the
	 context &#x2014; in this case the UBL 1.0 Procurement
	 Process &#x2014; and the metadata requirements of <a
	 href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a>.</p>
  <p>Document assembly starts with the definition of each of the
	 business documents comprising UBL 1.0 as an Aggregate BIE
	 (object class) for the document type.  All the other
	 Aggregate BIEs (object classes) for the document type are
	 derived by traversing the associations from this
	 Aggregate BIE to form the required hierarchy.  The roles
	 chosen for each association between Aggregate BIEs become
	 Association BIEs.</p>
  <p>For example, the document assembly model for the top level of
	 the UBL 1.0 Order document is shown below using a UML
	 class diagram.</p>
  <div><img src="uml/concept/assy/UBL-1.0-OrderDocumentAssembly.jpg"

  </blockquote>
  <p>While it is possible to develop document assembly models using
	UML, it was found easier in practice to use a spreadsheet
	notation, the key advantages being:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>The additional metadata required by <a href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a> is easily
  defined</p></li>
  <li><p>Formulas can be applied to naming rules</p></li>
  <li><p>Spreadsheets can be mapped directly to the submission
  format for candidate Core Components required byUN/CEFACT
  TBG17</p></li>
  <li><p>Spreadsheets are familiar to the business experts
  responsible for the data modeling</p></li>
  <li><p>The format has proven portable between
  applications</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These advantages were felt to outweigh the main disadvantage of
	spreadsheet notation, which is the lack of referential
	integrity controls in the modeling language itself; manual
	editing is required to control the impact of changes.  In
	this case, fortunately, the commercial tool used to
	generate the final schemas from the spreadsheets was also
	capable of verifying model integrity.</p>
  <h3>B.3.1 Spreadsheet Models</h3> 
  <p>UBL uses spreadsheets to describe the assembly of components
	into specific types of documents. There is one spreadsheet
	assembly model for each document type.</p>
  <p>Following the terminology of <a href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a>, the
	document assembly models are composed of a combination of
	Basic Business Information Entities (the attributes of the
	component model), Aggregate Business Information Entities
	(the object classes of the component model), and
	Association Business Information Entities (the roles of
	associations in the component model). BBIEs can be
	considered the &#x201C;leaf nodes&#x201D; of the data structures, ABIEs as
	structures that contain BBIEs, and ASBIEs as the
	containership of one ABIE within another.</p>
  <p>The spreadsheet models use rows to define
	components. Components are either BIEs or Data
	Types. Columns define the metadata associated with each
	component type. Many of the spreadsheet columns are
	determined by <a href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a> requirements.</p>
  <p>A spreadsheet assembly model will therefore consist of a
	 &#x201C;root&#x201D; ABIE, a set of BBIEs, and a set of ASBIEs. The
	 ABIEs associated with the &#x201C;root&#x201D; ABIE are defined in a
	 Reusable BIE spreadsheet model.</p>
  <p>The data types for all BBIEs are defined either in the
	Unspecialized Datatypes spreadsheet model or the
	Specialized Datatypes spreadsheet model.</p>
  <p>The dependencies among these spreadsheet assembly models are
	shown in the diagram below.</p>
  <div><img alt="[spreadsheet model dependency diagram]"
	 src="art/UBL-1.0-ModelDependency.jpg" /> 
	 <p><b>Figure B-5. Spreadsheet Model Dependencies</b></p></div> 
  <p>The spreadsheet files included in this package are provided
	 in both Microsoft Excel format (.xls) and Open Office
	 format (.sxc) as described below.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> The UBL document schemas are automatically
	generated from these spreadsheet models.  <b>However, the
	normative forms of the UBL documents are not these
	spreadsheet models but the XSD schemas themselves, which
	are provided in Section 6.</b></p>
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h3>B.3.2 Document Spreadsheets</h3>

	row. Row background colour distinguishes between BBIE
	(white), ABIE (pink), and ASBIE (green).</p>

  <h3>B.3.4 Customizing Models</h3> 
  <p>While those wishing to customize UBL should follow the
	guidelines for the customization of UBL 1.0 schemas
	referenced from B.7 below, those who choose to modify
	either the Component or Assembly models directly and use
	UBL as the basis for a new vocabulary should be aware of
	the following considerations that may impact compatibility
	with UBL:</p>
  <ul> 
	<li> 
		<p>First, any modification of the spreadsheet
		models requires an understanding of their
		structure, the ebXML Core Components Technical
		Specification <a href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a>, and the
		various UBL library constituents. For example,
		some columns are updated directly, while others
		have formulas in their cells which implement <a
		href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a> and UBL Naming and Design
		Rules. Awareness of this is necessary when adding
		or editing the row contents. Care should be taken
		to avoid updating cells that contain
		formulas.</p></li>
	<li> 
		<p>Second, schema generation should be compliant
		with the UBL Naming and Design Rules (B.4 below)
		to promote compatibility with other UBL component
		libraries.</p></li>
	<li> 
		<p>Third, the data types defined in the Core
		Component Types and Unspecialized Datatypes models
		are direct implementations of those defined in <a
		href="#ccts">[CCTS]</a> and should not be modified
		without recognition of this fact. The Specialized
		Data Types model is provided for
		implementation-specific data types.</p></li>
  </ul> 
  <p>The UBL 1.0 document component and document assembly models
	are the product of the OASIS UBL Library Content
	Subcommittee. The work of the UBL LCSC can be viewed on

  <h2>B.5 Schema Generation</h2> 
  <p>The UBL 1.0 XSD schemas are the output of a transformation that applies
	schema construction rules to the Data Model represented by the UBL spreadsheets
	described in B.3 above. The transformation process consisted of the following
	steps:</p> 
  <ol> 
	<li>Reading in the data model spreadsheets</li> 
	<li>Building from each spreadsheet an internal UML-based model</li> 
	<li>Identifying external standards for code lists and including standard
		code list values as appropriate</li> 
	<li>Applying UBL Naming and Design Rules</li> 
	<li>Outputting conformant XSD schemas</li> 
  </ol> 
  <p>A commercial CC-aware schema generation tool, GEFEG
	EDIFIX&#x00AE; 5.0, was used to read the spreadsheets as
	UML data models, perform Q/A with them, and produce a
	schema representation adhering to the UBL 1.0 Naming and
	Design Rules, as illustrated below. For information
	regarding GEFEG EDIFIX&#x00AE;, see <a
	href="http://www.gefeg.com/en/standard/xml/ubl.htm">http://www.gefeg.com/en/standard/xml/ubl.htm</a>.
	The GEFEG EDIFIX&#x00AE; 5.0 UBL Reader is free and offers
	easy viewing of UBL schemas and data models. For
	information regarding GEFEG EDIFIX&#x00AE; UBL Reader, see

	schemas, see Appendix D of the 1.0 Beta Committee Draft at

  <h2>B.6 Implementation Model</h2> 
  <p>The implementation model of UBL represents the actual UBL XSD schemas as a
	UML model. This is produced by automatically transforming the schemas into a
	model conformant with the Unified Modeling Language <a href="#uml">[UML]</a>. This model is then
	used to produce a set of class diagrams that illustrate each of the main
	documents and several views of the reusable components. The automated
	transformation and diagram creation was performed using a commercial
	schema-to-UML transformation tool, Ontogenics <i>hyper</i>Model. For further
	details regarding this product, see <a
	href="http://www.xmlmodeling.com/">http://www.xmlmodeling.com/</a>.</p> 
  <p>The UML class diagrams contained in this section are intended to help
	understand the UBL schemas without requiring an understanding of XSD syntax. In
	order to do this, the diagrams intentionally suppress some of the detail
	contained in the schemas. For example, information regarding the order of
	elements within a complex type definition is not preserved in the diagrams.
	Other changes were made to make the UML model useful for software engineering;
	for example, the &#x201C;Type&#x201D; suffixes of XSD complexType names are removed when
	creating the UML class name to yield an object class name independent of XSD
	syntax, and complex type child elements with simple content values are
	represented as class attributes, whereas elements with complex content are
	represented as associations to those type classes.</p> 
  <p>These diagrams are the UML equivalent of the document
	assembly spreadsheet models.</p>
  <div class="newpage"></div>
  <h3>B.6.1 Document Implementation Diagrams</h3> 
  <p>An implementation class diagram has been created for each of the eight UBL
	1.0 document types. As noted above, the implementation diagrams are simplified
	views that suppress details of the types contained in these aggregate
	structures. As an example, the class diagram for the UBL Order document is
	shown in the figure below.</p>

	physical attributes to get the precise item that he wants:
	some windows are asymmetric and are &#x201C;handed&#x201D;
	left or right; most door sets are handed, as they are
	hinged on one side; the wood and its finish must be
	specified, as must the &#x201C;fittings&#x201D; (handles,
	stays etc.). Items can be glazed in different ways. Loose
	timber is coded according to its cross section, and the
	length must be specified. While the buyer knows these
	things from the catalogue, he does not know the current
	prices or any discount rate he may get.</p>

  <p>The Despatch Advice travels with the delivery; a paper copy is signed and
	returned as proof of receipt. Hence the UBL Receipt Advice is not used.</p> 
<p>The Seller raises the Invoice automatically when the despatch
	occurs, and the resolution of any shortages is handled
	post-invoicing. The Invoice has to show the tax point
	date, the VAT (Value Added Tax) category to which the item
	belongs, and also the VAT rate and total for each tax
	category on the invoice. VAT is also applied to charges
	such as the delivery surcharge. In order to encourage
	speedy payment of the amount due, the Seller offers a
	discount for prompt settlement, which the buyer can deduct
	if paying within 30 days. (This example was written for a
	context in which regulations assume the VAT will be taken,
	so the tax here is calculated on the trade discounted
	total of line items plus any charges and less the
	settlement discount amount.)</p>

	UBL documents. The UBL ASN.1 XML schema enables ASN.1 tools to be
	used for UBL transfers, and in conjunction with the ASN.1
	Packed Encoding Rules, it provides a specification for an
	efficient binary encoding of UBL messages.</p>
	<blockquote><dl><dt><b>UBL ASN.1 Specification</b></dt>
	<dd><a href="asn/ASN.1-UBL-1.0.html">asn/ASN.1-UBL-1.0.html</a></dd></dl></blockquote>
	<p>The ASN.1 UBL specification was created using a tool from
	<a href="http://www.oss.com/">OSS Nokalva</a> (http://www.oss.com/)
	that conforms to ITU-T Recommendation X.694 | ISO/IEC 8825-5
	for converting XSD Schema to ASN.1. After conversion, the
	generated ASN.1 was formatted by the PrettyPrint tool at the <a
	href="http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr/">ASN.1 Information Site
	</a> (http://asn1.elibel.tm.fr) to produce the HTML 
	file included in this package.</p>
  <h1><a name="ONGOING"></a>Appendix G (Informative): Ongoing Work Items</h1>
  <p>UBL 1.0 achieves the basic objective of the first phase of
	the UBL charter &#x2014; to develop a workable standard
	library of XML business documents.  The second phase (UBL
	2.0) is intended to produce additions to the UBL library
	and schema set and a mechanism for the automatic
	generation of context-specific business schemas.</p>
  <p>Between these milestones lie a number of work items that for
	one reason or another could not be completed in time for
	delivery of UBL 1.0.  Some of these items represent work
	of continuing interest; others represent cases where an
	issue could not achieve a consensus solution within the
	time set for UBL 1.0 delivery but for which an acceptable
	short-term strategy could be adopted with little or no
	impact on the long-term validity of UBL 1.0 document
	instances.  The UBL TC intends to resolve these issues and
	release an updated version called UBL 1.1 that will be
	backward-compatible with UBL 1.0 instances.</p>
  <p>In the following, these work items have been loosely grouped
	under four headings: NDR Work Items, Interoperability Work
	Items, Registry Work Items, and Localization Work Items.
	Persons interested in participating in this program of
	work are invited to join the OASIS UBL TC.</p>
<h2>G.1 NDR Work Items</h2>
  <p>The following items are related to UBL Naming and Design
	Rules (NDR).</p>
<h3>G.1.1 Publication of UBL NDR as a Separate Specification</h3>
  <p>Time constraints prevented completion of the UBL Naming and
	Design Rules (NDR) document as a separate specification
	for delivery with UBL 1.0; the document included in this
	package and referenced as [NDR] contains only the rules
	checklist for 1.0.  Work continues to prepare the NDR
	document for submission as a separate OASIS technical
	specification.</p>
<h3>G.1.2 Substitution Groups for Code List Customization</h3>
  <p>The UBL Code List Subcommittee has produced a comprehensive
	solution for code lists (see Appendix E) that relies upon
	XSD substitution groups for code list customization.
	Lacking a clear industry consensus on the use of XSD
	substitution groups in business document schemas, the UBL
	TC has deferred the adoption of this extension mechanism
	for code lists pending further discussion.  Care has been
	taken to construct UBL 1.0 in a way that will allow the
	adoption of substitution groups (if deemed appropriate) in
	later releases without invalidating UBL 1.0 instances.</p>
<h3>G.1.3 Importation of Codelist Schema Modules</h3>
  <p>It is an open question whether it is better to import the
	codelist schema modules (Section 6.3) indirectly via the
	Specialized Datatype schema (Section 6.2.2) or directly
	into the Common Aggregate Component schema (Section 6.2.1)
	and any individual document schemas where they are
	used. In UBL 1.0, codelist schema modules are imported
	directly, but concerns have been raised regarding a
	possible impact on performance.  Feedback from UBL 1.0
	implementation will be relied upon in resolving this
	issue.  A change to the alternative is not expected to
	affect UBL 1.0 instances.</p>
<h3>G.1.4 Location of Qualified BBIE Property Element Definitions</h3>
  <p>In UBL 1.0, all BBIE properties are declared as elements and
	defined as complex types in the Common Basic Components
	schema (Section 6.2.1). Alternatively, the qualified BBIE
	property elements could be declared in either the Common
	Aggregate Components schema or in the individual document
	schemas where they are used.  This issue remains open, but
	any change in future releases will not affect UBL 1.0
	instances.</p>
<h2>G.2 Registry Work Items</h2>
  <p>The following issues relate to the storage and registration
	of UBL schemas.</p>
<h3>G.2.1 Relative Paths in Schema Modules</h3>
  <p>UBL NDR identified a requirement for absolute path names for
	schema locations as a necessary requirement for standards
	based schemas to ensure consistency, clarity, and absolute
	assurances that the UBL normative schemas are in fact being
	used.  However, current OASIS architecture limitations
	preclude the availability of a suitable
	registry/repository to support this requirement.  As a
	result, UBL 1.0 has been released using relative path
	names for the location of schemas in order to facilitate
	offline validation and to work around those limitations.
	Use of absolute paths and a registry for the component
	library will be implemented in a future version as the
	supporting infrastructure becomes available.</p>
<h3>G.2.2 Version Element in the Documentation of Every BIE</h3>
  <p>UBL 1.0 assumes that the version number of each UBL datatype
	and BIE is also 1.0.  However, there is some debate as to
	whether this is a schema construct artifact or a storage
	artifact.  The outcome of this decision may result in a
	requirement to assign a version number in the annotation
	documentation for each datatype and BIE schema
	construct.</p>
<h2>G.3 Interoperability Work Items</h2>
  <p>The following work items relate to the interoperability of
	UBL documents across industries and in relation to other
	business document standards.</p>
<h3>G.3.1 UBL Conformance</h3>
  <p>While much initial work has been done toward defining the
	concept of UBL conformance in the UBL 1.0 Customization
	Guidelines (see Appendix B.7), further work is necessary
	to create a definition of UBL conformance that is usable
	in legal and regulatory contexts.</p>
<h3>G.3.2 Industry Profiles</h3>
  <p>It is considered likely that UBL 1.0 will be modified
	according to the UBL Customization Guidelines to create
	versions that are standard within particular industries
	and geographical regions.  Further work is needed to
	develop guidelines specific to this use case.</p>
<h3>G.3.3 Common CCTS Schemas</h3>
  <p>The schemas for Core Component Types and Datatypes included
	in this package (Section 6.2.2) were developed in
	cooperation with representatives of the Open Applications
	Group, Inc., but the versions currently used by the two
	organizations are not yet identical.  Differences between
	the CCTS schemas used in UBL 1.0 and OAGIS 9.0 have been
	identified in these five areas:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Naming of Supplementary Components as attributes</p></li>
  <li><p>Use of XSD normalizedString for code, identifier, and
	text components</p></li>
  <li><p>Use of XSD built-in dataypes requiring format
	Supplementary Components (Date Time, Indicator and
	Numeric)</p></li>
  <li><p>Restrictions on Binary Object for Graphic, Picture, Sound
	and Video data type</p></li>
  <li><p>Patterns for Indicator data type</p></li>
  </ul>
  <p>A common set of CCTS schemas are expected to be available for
  UBL 1.1 and will be included at that time.  This is not expected
  to affect the validity of UBL 1.0 instances.</p>
<h3>G.3.4 Core Component Harmonization</h3>
  <p>As an implementation of [CCTS], UBL supports the concept of a
	common semantic library of business components. To achieve
	this, UBL is working with the UN/CEFACT International
	Trade and Business Processes Working Group on
	Harmonization, known as TBG17
	(http://webster.disa.org/cefact-groups/tbg/wg/tbg17_main.cfm).
	This group is responsible for consistency and
	harmonization of business process models and core
	components across business domains and sectors,
	contributing to a concise and well-defined glossary of
	business terms, business data semantic definitions, and
	structuring of data exchanges.  Cooperation with TBG17 is
	a continuing work item for UBL.</p>
<h3>G.3.5 Context Methodology</h3>
  <p>While the delivery of an automatic context methodology
	belongs to UBL 2.0, work on this item continues in the UBL
	1.1 time frame.  This includes further refinement of the
	Customization Guidelines referenced in B.7 of this
	specification.</p>
<h2>G.4 Localization Work Items</h2>
  <p>UBL has formed several localization subcommittees (LSCs) to
	translate the UBL specification and associated
	documentation into languages other than English and to
	represent the UBL effort in non-English-speaking regional
	contexts.  These regional initiatives will account for
	much of the work to be performed in the UBL 1.1 time
	frame.  As of April 2004, UBL localization subcommittees
	had been established for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and
	Spanish.</p>
